# Mindustry-Mate
My first non-academic project where I build an agent that will eventually empoy reinforcement learning in its decision making processes!

## Introduction

I've never been a big tower defense guy, but have **loved** factories and producton games. So I figured given the recent changes with AI that have come into light, I wanted to finally get around to making a tried and true agent of some kind.

# Future Plans
My original hope was to eventually get the project to a point where I can introduce a two-part "Drop-in" mode for Mindustry Mate. 
"Co-pilot":  Similar to how Cortana assists Master Chief in Halo, the co-pilot mode would be designed so that the player can toggle interactivity from Mindustry Mate.  Similarly, they could also have MindustryMate talk to them to verablize the proposed actions given the state the player is in.

"Mindustry Mode" - This mode grants Mindustry Mate full control of the game (until interrupted of course), though it will refrain from interacting when outside of a level
